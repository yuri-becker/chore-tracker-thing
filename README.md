  <p align="center">
    (WIP) Self-hostable, multi-user- and multi-tenant-capable application to manage household chores.
  </p>
</div>
<br/>

## About the Project

This project began with us looking for an open-source solution to track household chores, that was both simple to use
and still versatile enough, needing something that

* is mobile-first,
* doesn't get in the way,
* is focused around recurring tasks,
* is lenient about when tasks are completed (depression-friendly), and
* supports multiple users per household and multiple households per user .

None of the existing solutions fit our needs, so we decided to develop our own â€“ Chore-Tracker-Thing.

Chore-Tracker-Thing is trying to achieve exactly what we needed and is designed to be self-hosted with an
OIDC-compatible authentication backend like Authelia.

## Development

### Prerequisites

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* For Backend development [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), but it can also be run in Docker if
  you don't plan to make any code changes.
* Any IDE of your choice. Project ships with configuration for Jetbrains IDEs.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Set-up

After installing the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) and cloning the project, create a file called `.env.local` and
define the following values in it:

```env
CHORES_OIDC_ENDPOINT=
CHORES_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=
CHORES_OIDC_CLIENT_PASSWORD=
CHORES_SECRET=
```

Consult [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for more guidance on what you set this to. Please note that not
all environment variables marked as required need to be set here, as there is another, shared `.env` for development.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Running

To run the frontend use

```sh
cd web
yarn dev
```

Vite proxies `/api` and `/oidc` to the backend.

If you want to run the database and backend via Docker (recommended if you don't want to do code changes in there), use

```sh
docker compose up
```

Otherwise, you can run the database only via

```sh
docker compose up postgres
```

and then run the backend with

```sh
cargo run
```
