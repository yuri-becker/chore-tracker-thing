  <p align="center">
    (WIP) Self-hostable, multi-user- and multi-tenant-capable application to manage household chores.

## About the Project

This project began with us looking for an open-source solution to track household chores, that was both simple to use
and still versatile enough, needing something that

* is mobile-first,
* doesn't get in the way,
* is focused around recurring tasks,
* is lenient about when tasks are completed (depression-friendly), and
* supports multiple users per household and multiple households per user .

None of the existing solutions fit our needs, so we decided to develop our own â€“ Chore-Tracker-Thing.

Chore-Tracker-Thing is trying to achieve exactly what we needed and is designed to be self-hosted with an
OIDC-compatible authentication backend like Authelia.

## Development

### Prerequisites

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* For Backend development [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), but it can also be run in Docker if
  you don't plan to make any code changes.
* Any IDE of your choice. Project ships with configuration for Jetbrains IDEs.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Set-up

Install the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) and clone the project.

If you need to override any [Environment Variables](#environment-variables), create a `.env.local` and set those in there. You would only need this if you,
for example, want to test with a production authentication provider, or you don't want to run postgres via docker compose.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Running

To run the frontend use

```sh
cd web
yarn dev
```

Vite proxies `/api` and `/oidc` to the backend.

If you want to run the database and backend via Docker (recommended if you don't want to do code changes in there), use

```sh
docker compose up
```

Otherwise, you can run only the database and authentication endpoint (dex) via

```sh
docker compose up postgres dex
```

and then run the backend with

```sh
cargo run
```

### Credentials

There are two users, both have the password `123`, for the e-mail address, enter either just `a` or `b`.
